# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, I am using this platform to explore and experiment with various programming languages. Advent of Code is an annual coding event that consists of a series of daily programming challenges throughout the month of December.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to challenge myself and enhance my programming skills by solving these puzzles using different languages. By doing so, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each language, as well as improve my problem-solving abilities.

## Structure

Each day of Advent of Code presents a new puzzle that needs to be solved. In this repository, you will find a separate folder for each day, containing the solution code written in a specific programming language.

## Languages

I plan to explore a wide range of programming languages during this Advent of Code journey. Some of the languages I intend to use include:

- Python
- JavaScript
- C
- Ruby
- Go
- Rust
- and many more!

## Conclusion

Let's embark on this coding adventure together and have fun exploring the world of programming languages through Advent of Code!

Happy coding!
